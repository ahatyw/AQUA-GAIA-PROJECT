## Project Overview

**AQUA-GAIA** is a **Global Aquatic Digital Twin** that monitors and predicts water health worldwide. The platform provides a **3D interactive Earth model** visualizing water quality, pollution levels, and freshwater availability across countries. It allows stakeholders, researchers, and policymakers to gain actionable insights into global aquatic systems.

---

## Motivation

Water scarcity and pollution are critical challenges affecting millions globally. Existing water monitoring systems are often static, delayed, and fragmented. **AQUA-GAIA** aims to create a dynamic, interactive digital twin of the Earth's aquatic systems, enabling **real-time insights**, **predictive analytics**, and **educational visualization** of water health globally.

## Features

- 🌍 **3D Interactive Earth** with detailed **country boundaries** and **aquatic textures**  
- 🖱 **Click on any country** to view its **Water Report Panel** including:
  - Water Quality Index  
  - Pollution Levels  
  - Freshwater Availability  
- 🌊 **Animated ocean currents** visualized with vector flow patterns  
- 📈 **Global Water Quality Trends** with dynamic charts  
- 🐢 **Underwater ecosystem visualization** with marine life and coral representation  
- 📊 **Pollutant Composition** charts (plastics, heavy metals, microbial)  
- 🖥 **User Interface** featuring project name at the top and author details at the bottom
